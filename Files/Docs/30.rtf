\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This is the start of a project to roll back the clock. As I slip into the depth of middle age there are ways my body just doesn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t feel right anymore. I get tired more easily, I have a bit too much around the waist, I have some joint aches. Conventional wisdom is that it\u8217\'92s only going to get worse. The long slide into old age is irreversible. But is that really true? Is all the struggle now just to slow the decline? Or is it possible to roll back the clock? Documented here is an attempt to do so. And to do so in a way that others can see what worked and what did not - founded on data and science. This book will explore the latest in scientific advances, things that are on the horizon, and things you can do today. But of course, scientific advances won\u8217\'92t get rid of the need for hard work. That will get documented here as well.}}
