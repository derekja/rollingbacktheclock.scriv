\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 44 year old white male. 220 Pounds. Five foot eleven. A former competitive wrestler - two time Canadian junior champion and a black belt in Judo. But the memory of those accomplishments rests more in my mind than my body. Twenty years of desk jobs in the high tech industry have wreaked their havoc on my base level of fitness and capability. No serious chronic illnesses. Allergies, a few of the symptoms of metabolic syndrome but no diabetes. A bit of osteoarthritis in an elbow, left over from an old injury from a motorcycle accident. Some anxiety and mood issues, but nothing under ongoing psychiatric care.}}
